# Suu no Nikki Launcher

## Project Description

This is a CLI/CLR (Common Language Interface/Runtime) desktop application that serves as the launcher for the game Sue's Diary. It is written in C++.

## Requirements
  * Visual Studio (2017 or earlier recommended, older versions are not guaranteed to work) with C++ CLI/CLR support
  * A copy of Sue's Diary - TBD

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jozsefsallai/Suu-no-Nikki-Launcher.git
cd Suu-no-Nikki-Launcher
```

### Open `Suu-no-Nikki-Launcher.sln` in Visual Studio

At this point you should be ready to go. In the following section, I'll explain what each file is there for.

## Project Source Files

### Launcher.cpp

Contains the main entry point of the program (`MainWin()`).

### Launcher.h

This file contains the form itself, with all the methods associated to it and its elements. You can open a Form Designer instance of this file in Visual Studio.

### Definitions.h

This header holds some constant definitions that are used across the project.

### DiscordRPC.cpp and DiscordRPC.h

This file wraps the function to start the Discord RPC connection for Rich Presence. It's used after pressing the "Play" button in the launcher.

### MapNames.cpp and MapNames.h

This file contains an `std::map<int, std::string>` that defines names for each map ID. It's used to display the map name in the Discord Rich Presence.

### Utils.cpp and Utils.h

Contains utility functions used across the project, such as a function that converts an `std::string` to an `std::wstring`.

## Dependencies

The `sdk` folder contains two header files that are the headers necessary to invoke functions from the Discord-RPC library. These are the original files from Discord's RPC library.

To save time and make dependencies less of a hassle, a `.dll` and a `.lib` file is included in the `sdk` folder. These were built using CMake, as described in [discordapp/discord-rpc](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc). If you want you can build it on your own and use your own DLL and LIB file.
